  app-url:
    description: |
      The URL to execute the tests against. This URL should serve the code from the current commit (e.g. a localhost URL served up by a local server).
      This will almost always have to be specified. It is mostly useful to omit this if `appUrl` differs between test
      cases within the same test run. In those cases it is expected all test cases to contain have `appUrl` set.
    required: false
  tests-file:
    description: |
      The path to the meticulous.json file containing the list of tests you want to run.

      If not set a search will be performed to find a meticulous.json file in the current directory or the nearest parent directory.

  max-retries-on-failure:
    description: |
      The number of times to re-run any replays that give a screenshot diff. If any of the retryed replays differs from that in the first replay
      then the original diff will be marked as a flake, and ignored.

      Setting to 0 disables this feature.
