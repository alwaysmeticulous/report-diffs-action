    required: true
  github-token:
    description: "GITHUB_TOKEN or a repo scoped PAT."
    required: true
    default: ${{ github.token }}
  app-url:
    description: |
      The URL to execute the tests against. This URL should serve the code from the current commit (e.g. a localhost URL served up by a local server).
      This will almost always have to be specified. It is mostly useful to omit this if `appUrl` differs between test
      cases within the same test run. In those cases it is expected all test cases to contain have `appUrl` set.
    required: false
  use-deployment-url:
    description: If set to 'true' Meticulous will test against the 'environmentUrl' of the latest deployment of the current commit.
    required: true
    default: "false"
  allowed-environments:
    description: |
      To only be used when 'use-deployment-url' is set to true. If set will ignore any deployments to environments with names not in this list. The names of multiple environments can be seperated by new lines.

      If allowed-environments is not specified then Meticulous will just test against the first deployment.

      You find your environment names in the 'Environments' tab in the 'Settings' tab of your GitHub repository.
    required: false
  tests-file:
    description: |
      The path to the meticulous.json file containing the list of tests you want to run.

      If not set a search will be performed to find a meticulous.json file in the current directory or the nearest parent directory.
    required: false
  max-retries-on-failure:
    description: |
      The number of times to re-run any replays that give a visual diff. If any of the retryed replays differs from that in the first replay
      then the original diff will be marked as a flake, and ignored.

      Setting to 0 disables this feature.
    required: true
    default: 5
  parallel-tasks:
    description: Number of tasks to run in parallel (defaults to two per CPU)
    required: false
  localhost-aliases:
    description: Additional aliases for localhost, as a list of comma-separated values
    required: false
  max-allowed-color-difference:
    description: A number between 0 and 1. The maximum difference in color/brightness for a pixel to ignore, and treat as unchanged. A value of 1.0 would accept any difference in color, while a value of 0.0 would accept no difference in color. Uses a measure of perceived color differences based on the paper "Measuring perceived color difference using YIQ NTSC transmission color space in mobile applications" by Y. Kotsarenko and F. Ramos. See https://jsfiddle.net/vpfwsxby/12/ for example differences.
    required: true
    default: 0.01
  max-allowed-proportion-of-changed-pixels:
    description: Maximum acceptable proportion of pixels that exceed the `max-allowed-color-difference`, as a number between 0 and 1. Differences in a smaller or equal proportional of pixels to this will be ignored. Defaults to 0.00001, or about 20 pixels in a 1920 x 1080 px visual snapshot.
    required: true
    default: 0.00001
  test-suite-id:
    description: Used to differentiate between different Meticulous test suites if you run this action multiple times as part of a single workflow.
    required: false
